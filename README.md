Today DongDong learned a lot about reverse engineering a program, and he wants to understand what is contained in the DLL files and other unknown file types. Note: A949999 (Tamer Vale) is an 18+ game that contains sexual content.

What DongDong wants to do for this game:

- Understand the program's logic and workflow.
- Identify what each file or component contains and how they fit together.
- Use tools (e.g., Cheat Engine) to experiment with and improve the game experience.
